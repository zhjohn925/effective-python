Modules, libraries and packages

Modules and packages can easily be confused because of their similarities, but there are a few differences. 
Despite the differences between modules, packages and libraries, you can import any of them using import statements. 

1. Modules are similar to files. Modules are generally written in a single file.
   Modules, can contain classes, functions and data members just like any other Python file. 

2. Packages are like directories that contain different files.   
   Packages are essentially a type of module. Any module that contains the  __path__ definition is a package. 
   Packages, when viewed as a directory, can contain sub-packages and other modules. 
   
3. Library is a term that's used interchangeably with imported packages. But in general practice, it refers to a collection of packages.
